For this homework I relied on looking at the classroom activities from week 12, stack overflow, the mongoDB documentation online, github, and the geeksforgeeks website. I also had a tutoring session with Kourt Bailey that was helpful. In particular, I was having a hard time determining how to find datatypes with mongodb items, and my tutoring session helped me with that. This week's challenge was easier for me than the webscraping assignment for module 11. I found this week made a lot more sense, and I felt really compfortable with working with pandas dataframes.
